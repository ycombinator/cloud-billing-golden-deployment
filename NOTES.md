- Golden deployments should be expected to keep running. No clean slate approach.
- Service might be responsible for ensuring golden deployments are up? Could be useful in a flaky environment like QA.
  - Will need to order vars + has with deployment config ID to get deployment ID (== scenario ID?)
  - See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/hcl/v2#section-readme for parsing out vars and defaults
- Validations should run daily and look back over a sliding window of a day or so.
- Use ILM to clean up test data so data usage is somewhat stable.
  - Part of workload spec?  
- Instead of generating and replaying workloads, dynamically generate and execute them as part of the service (test scenario run).
- For validations, initial implementation could be watcher-based, where validations (incl. thresholds + tolerances) are baked into watches running on the Usage Cluster.
- Getting service into production will most likely be the trickiest part. Not so much because of governance, but more knowing what the latest practices are.
